// openpilot's msgq queues read without subscribing.
//
// msgq gives every subscriber a reader slot in the queue's shared header and never gives it back
// (deleting a SubSocket only unmaps the ring, and a dead process's slots stay taken). A queue has
// NUM_READERS slots, and a subscriber that finds them all taken evicts every reader on the queue,
// openpilot's own included: loggerd on the encoder queues, which then loses frames and can die
// ("Process Not Running"). A subscriber that lives as long as the bridge process still took one
// slot per bridge restart.
//
// So commaviewd never subscribes. It maps the queue file read-only, keeps its read position to
// itself, and never writes to the shared memory: no reader slot, no read pointer, no valid flag,
// no uid, no signal, no ftruncate. openpilot's publisher and subscribers can't tell it is there, so
// any number of bridge restarts and client reconnects leave the queue exactly as they found it.
//
// The ring, as msgq_msg_send writes it (checked by scripts/upstream-interface-guard.sh):
//   header  msgq_header_t: num_readers, write_pointer, write_uid, then three NUM_READERS arrays.
//           NUM_READERS differs between forks (15 upstream, 25 in sunnypilot/openpilot), so the
//           header's size is worked out from the file at run time, never from this build's msgq.h.
//   data    messages back to back: an int64 size tag, the bytes, padded to 8. A -1 size tag means
//           the rest of the lap is unused and the next message is at offset 0 of the next lap.
//   write_pointer  (lap << 32) | offset of the next message. The writer stores the size tag and the
//           bytes, then a full barrier, then moves the pointer, so everything behind it is whole.
//   A message is at most a third of the ring (msgq asserts 3 * size <= ring size).
// The writer never waits for readers: a reader it laps just has its slot marked invalid. Here that
// is detected by comparing our private position with the write pointer before and after each copy.
